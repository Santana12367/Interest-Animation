What I prompted:

"How do I use nested loops to change the colors of an image stored in a 2D array, 
and how do I make sure I don't skip any pixels or crash the program?"

What response I recieved:

1. The Nested Loop Logic:
You use the outer loop to move down the rows and the inner loop to move across the columns. It looks like this:
java
for (int row = 0; row < pixels.length; row++) {
  for (int col = 0; col < pixels[0].length; col++) {
    // Logic to change pixel color goes here
  }
}
